1. Suppose you have a table that includes a nested column called "city" inside a column called "person", but when you try to submit the following query in BigQuery, it gives you an error. SELECT person FROM `project1.example.table1` WHERE city = "London" How would you correct the error? 
A. Add ", UNNEST(person)" before the WHERE clause. 
B. Change "person" to "person.city". C. Change "person" to "city.person". D. Add ", UNNEST(city)" before the WHERE clause. 
Answer – B
Explanation: To access the person.city column, you need to "UNNEST(person)" and JOIN it to table1 using a comma.

2. What are two of the benefits of using denormalized data structures in BigQuery? 
A. Reduces the amount of data processed, reduces the amount of storage required 
B. Increases query speed, makes queries simpler C. Reduces the amount of storage required, increases query speed 
D. Reduces the amount of data processed, increases query speed 
Answer – B
Explanation: Denormalization increases query speed for tables with billions of rows because BigQuery's performance degrades when doing JOINs on large tables, but with a denormalized data structure, you don't have to use JOINs, since all of the data has been combined into one table. Denormalization also makes queries simpler because you do not have to use JOIN clauses. Denormalization increases the amount of data processed and the amount of storage required because it creates redundant data.

3. Which of these statements about exporting data from BigQuery is false? 
A. To export more than 1 GB of data, you need to put a wildcard in the destination filename. 
B. The only supported export destination is Google Cloud Storage. C. Data can only be exported in JSON or Avro format. D. The only compression option available is GZIP. 
Answer – c

4. What are all of the BigQuery operations that Google charges for? 
A. Storage, queries, and streaming inserts B. Storage, queries, and loading data from a file 
C. Storage, queries, and exporting data D. Queries and streaming inserts 
Answer – A
Explanation: Google charges for storage, queries, and streaming inserts. Loading data from a file and exporting data are free operations. 

5. Which of the following is not possible using primitive roles? 
A. Give a user viewer access to BigQuery and owner access to Google Compute Engine instances. 
B. Give UserA owner access and UserB editor access for all datasets in a project. C. Give a user access to view all datasets in a project, but not run queries on them. D. Give GroupA owner access and GroupB editor access for all datasets in a project. 
Answer – C
Explanation: Primitive roles can be used to give owner, editor, or viewer access to a user or group, but they can't be used to separate data access permissions from job-running permissions.

6. Which of these statements about BigQuery caching is true? 
A. By default, a query's results are not cached. B. BigQuery caches query results for 48 hours. C. Query results are cached even if you specify a destination table. D. There is no charge for a query that retrieves its results from cache. 
Answer – D
Explanation: When query results are retrieved from a cached results table, you are not charged for the query. BigQuery caches query results for 24 hours, not 48 hours. Query results are not cached if you specify a destination table. A query's results are always cached except under certain conditions, such as if you specify a destination table.

7. Which of these sources can you not load data into BigQuery from? 
A. File upload B. Google Drive C. Google Cloud Storage 
D. Google Cloud SQL 
Answer – D
Explanation: You can load data into BigQuery from a file upload, Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, or Google Cloud Bigtable. It is not possible to load data into BigQuery directly from Google Cloud SQL. One way to get data from Cloud SQL to BigQuery would be to export data from Cloud SQL to Cloud Storage and then load it from there.

8. Which of the following statements about Legacy SQL and Standard SQL is not true? 
A. Standard SQL is the preferred query language for BigQuery. B. If you write a query in Legacy SQL, it might generate an error if you try to run it with Standard SQL. C. One difference between the two query languages is how you specify fully-qualified table names (i.e. table names that include their associated project name). D. You need to set a query language for each dataset and the default is Standard SQL. 
Answer – D
Explanation: You do not set a query language for each dataset. It is set each time you run a query and the default query language is Legacy SQL. Standard SQL has been the preferred query language since BigQuery 2.0 was released. In legacy SQL, to query a table with a project-qualified name, you use a colon, :, as a separator. In standard SQL, you use a period, ., instead. Due to the differences in syntax between the two query languages (such as with project-qualified table names), if you write a query in Legacy SQL, it might generate an error if you try to run it with Standard SQL.

9. How would you query specific partitions in a BigQuery table? 
A. Use the DAY column in the WHERE clause
B. Use the EXTRACT(DAY) clause 
C. Use the __PARTITIONTIME pseudo-column in the WHERE clause 
D. Use DATE BETWEEN in the WHERE clause 
Answer – C
Explanation: Partitioned tables include a pseudo column named _PARTITIONTIME that contains a date-based timestamp for data loaded into the table. To limit a query to particular partitions (such as Jan 1st and 2nd of 2017), use a clause similar to this: WHERE _PARTITIONTIME BETWEEN TIMESTAMP('2017-01-01') AND TIMESTAMP('2017-01-02') 

10. Which SQL keyword can be used to reduce the number of columns processed by BigQuery? 
A. BETWEEN 
B. WHERE C. SELECT D. LIMIT 
Answer – C
Explanation: SELECT allows you to query specific columns rather than the whole table. LIMIT, BETWEEN, and WHERE clauses will not reduce the number of columns processed by BigQuery.

11. To give a user read permission for only the first three columns of a table, which access control method would you use? 
Answer: C 
A. Primitive role B. Predefined role C. Authorized view D. It's not possible to give access to only the first three columns of a table. 
Answer – C 
Explanation - An authorized view allows you to share query results with particular users and groups without giving them read access to the underlying tables. Authorized views can only be created in a dataset that does not contain the tables queried by the view. When you create an authorized view, you use the view's SQL query to restrict access to only the rows and columns you want the users to see. 

12. What are two methods that can be used to denormalize tables in BigQuery? 
A. 1) Split table into multiple tables; 2) Use a partitioned table 
B. 1) Join tables into one table; 2) Use nested repeated fields 
C. 1) Use a partitioned table; 2) Join tables into one table D. 1) Use nested repeated fields; 2) Use a partitioned table 
Answer – B
Explanation: The conventional method of denormalizing data involves simply writing a fact, along with all its dimensions, into a flat table structure. For example, if you are dealing with sales transactions, you would write each individual fact to a record, along with the accompanying dimensions such as order and customer information. The other method for denormalizing data takes advantage of BigQuery’s native support for nested and repeated structures in JSON or Avro input data. Expressing records using nested and repeated structures can provide a more natural representation of the underlying data. In the case of the sales order, the outer part of a JSON structure would contain the order and customer information, and the inner part of the structure would contain the individual line items of the order, which would be represented as nested, repeated elements.

13. Which of these is not a supported method of putting data into a partitioned table? 
A. If you have existing data in a separate file for each day, then create a partitioned table and upload each file into the appropriate partition. B. Run a query to get the records for a specific day from an existing table and for the destination table, specify a partitioned table ending with the day in the format "$YYYYMMDD". 
C. Create a partitioned table and stream new records to it every day. D. Use ORDER BY to put a table's rows into chronological order and then change the table's type to "Partitioned". 
Answer – D

14. Which of these operations can you perform from the BigQuery Web UI? 
A. Upload a file in SQL format. B. Load data with nested and repeated fields. 
C. Upload a 20 MB file. D. Upload multiple files using a wildcard. 
Answer – B




15. Which methods can be used to reduce the number of rows processed by BigQuery? 
A. Splitting tables into multiple tables; putting data in partitions B. Splitting tables into multiple tables; putting data in partitions; using the LIMIT clause 
C. Putting data in partitions; using the LIMIT clause D. Splitting tables into multiple tables; using the LIMIT clause 
Answer – A
Explanation: If you split a table into multiple tables (such as one table for each day), then you can limit your query to the data in specific tables (such as for particular days). A better method is to use a partitioned table, as long as your data can be separated by the day. If you use the LIMIT clause, BigQuery will still process the entire table. 

16. Which of these numbers are adjusted by a neural network as it learns from a training dataset (select 2 answers)? 
A. Weights B. Biases C. Continuous features 
D. Input values 
Answer – AB
Explanation: A neural network is a simple mechanism that’s implemented with basic math. The only difference between the traditional programming model and a neural network is that you let the computer determine the parameters (weights and bias) by learning from training datasets.

17. The CUSTOM tier for Cloud Machine Learning Engine allows you to specify the number of which types of cluster nodes? 
A. Workers B. Masters, workers, and parameter servers 
C. Workers and parameter servers D. Parameter servers 
Answer: C 
Explanation: The CUSTOM tier is not a set tier, but rather enables you to use your own cluster specification. When you use this tier, set values to configure your processing cluster according to these guidelines: You must set TrainingInput.masterType to specify the type of machine to use for your master node. You may set TrainingInput.workerCount to specify the number of workers to use. You may set TrainingInput.parameterServerCount to specify the number of parameter servers to use. You can specify the type of machine for the master node, but you can't specify more than one master node.

18. Which software libraries are supported by Cloud Machine Learning Engine? 
A. Theano and TensorFlow 
B. Theano and Torch C. TensorFlow D. TensorFlow and Torch 
Answer: C 
Explanation: Cloud ML Engine mainly does two things: Enables you to train machine learning models at scale by running TensorFlow training applications in the cloud. Hosts those trained models for you in the cloud so that you can use them to get predictions about new data.

19. Which TensorFlow function can you use to configure a categorical column if you don't know all of the possible values for that column? 
A. categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list 
B. categorical_column_with_hash_bucket C. categorical_column_with_unknown_values
 D. sparse_column_with_keys 
Answer: B 
Explanation: If you know the set of all possible feature values of a column and there are only a few of them, you can use categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list. Each key in the list will get assigned an auto- incremental ID starting from 0. What if we don't know the set of possible values in advance? Not a problem. We can use categorical_column_with_hash_bucket instead. What will happen is that each possible value in the feature column occupation will be hashed to an integer ID as we encounter them in training. 


21.	Which of the following statements about the Wide & Deep Learning model are true? (Select 2 answers.) 
A. The wide model is used for memorization, while the deep model is used for generalization. 
B. A good use for the wide and deep model is a recommender system. C. The wide model is used for generalization, while the deep model is used for memorization. 
D. A good use for the wide and deep model is a small-scale linear regression problem. 
Answer – AB
Explanation: Can we teach computers to learn like humans do, by combining the power of memorization and generalization? It's not an easy question to answer, but by jointly training a wide linear model (for memorization) alongside a deep neural network (for generalization), one can combine the strengths of both to bring us one step closer. At Google, we call it Wide & Deep Learning. It's useful for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs (categorical features with a large number of possible feature values), such as recommender systems, search, and ranking problems.

22.	To run a TensorFlow training job on your own computer using Cloud Machine Learning Engine, what would your command start with? 
A. gcloud ml-engine local train B. gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training C. gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training local D. You can't run a TensorFlow program on your own computer using Cloud ML Engine . 
Answer: A 
Explanation: gcloud ml-engine local train - run a Cloud ML Engine training job locally This command runs the specified module in an environment similar to that of a live Cloud ML Engine Training Job. This is especially useful in the case of testing distributed models, as it allows you to validate that you are properly interacting with the Cloud ML Engine cluster configuration.




23.	If you want to create a machine learning model that predicts the price of a particular stock based on its recent price history, what type of estimator should you use? 
A. Unsupervised learning 
B. Regressor C. Classifier D. Clustering estimator 
Answer – B
Explanation: Regression is the supervised learning task for modeling and predicting continuous, numeric variables. Examples include predicting real-estate prices, stock price movements, or student test scores. Classification is the supervised learning task for modeling and predicting categorical variables. Examples include predicting employee churn, email spam, financial fraud, or student letter grades. Clustering is an unsupervised learning task for finding natural groupings of observations (i.e. clusters) based on the inherent structure within your dataset. Examples include customer segmentation, grouping similar items in e-commerce, and social network analysis.

24. Suppose you have a dataset of images that are each labeled as to whether or not they contain a human face. To create a neural network that recognizes human faces in images using this labeled dataset, what approach would likely be the most effective? 
A. Use K-means Clustering to detect faces in the pixels. B. Use feature engineering to add features for eyes, noses, and mouths to the input data. C. Use deep learning by creating a neural network with multiple hidden layers to automatically detect features of faces. D. Build a neural network with an input layer of pixels, a hidden layer, and an output layer with two categories. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: Traditional machine learning relies on shallow nets, composed of one input and one output layer, and at most one hidden layer in between. More than three layers (including input and output) qualifies as “deep” learning. So deep is a strictly defined, technical term that means more than one hidden layer. In deep-learning networks, each layer of nodes trains on a distinct set of features based on the previous layer’s output. The further you advance into the neural net, the more complex the features your nodes can recognize, since they aggregate and recombine features from the previous layer. A neural network with only one hidden layer would be unable to automatically recognize high-level features of faces, such as eyes, because it wouldn't be able to "build" these features using previous hidden layers that detect low-level features, such as lines. Feature engineering is difficult to perform on raw image data. K-means Clustering is an unsupervised learning method used to categorize unlabeled data. 
25. What are two of the characteristics of using online prediction rather than batch prediction? 
A. It is optimized to handle a high volume of data instances in a job and to run more complex models. 
B. Predictions are returned in the response message. C. Predictions are written to output files in a Cloud Storage location that you specify. D. It is optimized to minimize the latency of serving predictions. 
Answer - BD
Explanation: Online prediction .Optimized to minimize the latency of serving predictions. .Predictions returned in the response message. 
Batch prediction .Optimized to handle a high volume of instances in a job and to run more complex models. .Predictions written to output files in a Cloud Storage location that you specify.

26. Which of these are examples of a value in a sparse vector? (Select 2 answers.) 
A. [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
B. [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] 
C. [0, 1] D. [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
Answer: CD 
Explanation: Categorical features in linear models are typically translated into a sparse vector in which each possible value has a corresponding index or id. For example, if there are only three possible eye colors you can represent 'eye_color' as a length 3 vector: 'brown' would become [1, 0, 0], 'blue' would become [0, 1, 0] and 'green' would become [0, 0, 1]. These vectors are called "sparse" because they may be very long, with many zeros, when the set of possible values is very large (such as all English words). [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] is not a sparse vector because it has two 1s in it. A sparse vector contains only a single 1. [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] is not a sparse vector because it has a 5 in it. Sparse vectors only contain 0s and 1s. 



27. How can you get a neural network to learn about relationships between categories in a categorical feature? 
A. Create a multi-hot column B. Create a one-hot column C. Create a hash bucket D. Create an embedding column 
Answer – D
Explanation: There are two problems with one-hot encoding. First, it has high dimensionality, meaning that instead of having just one value, like a continuous feature, it has many values, or dimensions. This makes computation more time-consuming, especially if a feature has a very large number of categories. The second problem is that it doesn’t encode any relationships between the categories. They are completely independent from each other, so the network has no way of knowing which ones are similar to each other. 
Both of these problems can be solved by representing a categorical feature with an embedding column. The idea is that each category has a smaller vector with, let’s say, 5 values in it. But unlike a one-hot vector, the values are not usually 0. The values are weights, similar to the weights that are used for basic features in a neural network. The difference is that each category has a set of weights (5 of them in this case). You can think of each value in the embedding vector as a feature of the category. So, if two categories are very similar to each other, then their embedding vectors should be very similar too. 

28. If a dataset contains rows with individual people and columns for year of birth, country, and income, how many of the columns are continuous and how many are categorical? 
A. 1 continuous and 2 categorical B. 3 categorical C. 3 continuous D. 2 continuous and 1 categorical 
Answer: D 
Explanation: The columns can be grouped into two types—categorical and continuous columns: A column is called categorical if its value can only be one of the categories in a finite set. For example, the native country of a person (U.S., India, Japan, etc.) or the education level (high school, college, etc.) are categorical columns. A column is called continuous if its value can be any numerical value in a continuous range. For example, the capital gain of a person (e.g. $14,084) is a continuous column. Year of birth and income are continuous columns. Country is a categorical column. You could use bucketization to turn year of birth and/or income into categorical features, but the raw columns are continuous.

29. Which of the following are examples of hyperparameters? (Select 2 answers.) 
A. Number of hidden layers B. Number of nodes in each hidden layer C. Biases D. Weights 
Answer: AB 
Explanation: If model parameters are variables that get adjusted by training with existing data, your hyperparameters are the variables about the training process itself. For example, part of setting up a deep neural network is deciding how many "hidden" layers of nodes to use between the input layer and the output layer, as well as how many nodes each layer should use. These variables are not directly related to the training data at all. They are configuration variables. Another difference is that parameters change during a training job, while the hyperparameters are usually constant during a job. Weights and biases are variables that get adjusted during the training process, so they are not hyperparameters.

30. Which of the following are feature engineering techniques? (Select 2 answers) 
A. Hidden feature layers B. Feature prioritization C. Crossed feature columns D. Bucketization of a continuous feature 
Answers – CD
Explanation: Selecting and crafting the right set of feature columns is key to learning an effective model. Bucketization is a process of dividing the entire range of a continuous feature into a set of consecutive bins/buckets, and then converting the original numerical feature into a bucket ID (as a categorical feature) depending on which bucket that value falls into. Using each base feature column separately may not be enough to explain the data. To learn the differences between different feature combinations, we can add crossed feature columns to the model.

31. You want to use a BigQuery table as a data sink. In which writing mode(s) can you use BigQuery as a sink? 
A. Both batch and streaming B. BigQuery cannot be used as a sink 
C. Only batch D. Only streaming 
Answer: A 
Explanation: When you apply a BigQueryIO.Write transform in batch mode to write to a single table, Dataflow invokes a BigQuery load job. When you apply a BigQueryIO.Write transform in streaming mode or in batch mode using a function to specify the destination table, Dataflow uses BigQuery's streaming inserts

32. You have a job that you want to cancel. It is a streaming pipeline, and you want to ensure that any data that is in-flight is processed and written to the output. Which of the following commands can you use on the Dataflow monitoring console to stop the pipeline job? 
A. Cancel 
B. Drain 
C. Stop 
D. Finish 
Answer: B 
Explanation: Using the Drain option to stop your job tells the Dataflow service to finish your job in its current state. Your job will immediately stop ingesting new data from input sources, but the Dataflow service will preserve any existing resources (such as worker instances) to finish processing and writing any buffered data in your pipeline.

33. When running a pipeline that has a BigQuery source, on your local machine, you continue to get permission denied errors. What could be the reason for that? 
A. Your gcloud does not have access to the BigQuery resources
B. BigQuery cannot be accessed from local machines 
C. You are missing gcloud on your machine 
D. Pipelines cannot be run locally 
Explanation: When reading from a Dataflow source or writing to a Dataflow sink using DirectPipelineRunner, the Cloud Platform account that you configured with the gcloud executable will need access to the corresponding source/sink

34. What Dataflow concept determines when a Window's contents should be output based on certain criteria being met? 
A. Sessions B. OutputCriteria 
C. Windows D. Triggers 
Answer: D 
Explanation: Triggers control when the elements for a specific key and window are output. As elements arrive, they are put into one or more windows by a Window transform and its associated WindowFn, and then passed to the associated Trigger to determine if the Windows contents should be output. 

35. Which of the following is NOT one of the three main types of triggers that Dataflow supports? 
Answer: A 
A. Trigger based on element size in bytes B. Trigger that is a combination of other triggers 
C. Trigger based on element count D. Trigger based on time 
Answer: A 
Explanation: There are three major kinds of triggers that Dataflow supports: 1. Time-based triggers 2. Data-driven triggers. You can set a trigger to emit results from a window when that window has received a certain number of data elements. 3. Composite triggers. These triggers combine multiple time-based or data-driven triggers in some logical way 

36. Which Java SDK class can you use to run your Dataflow programs locally? 
A. LocalRunner B. DirectPipelineRunner 
C. MachineRunner D. LocalPipelineRunner

A. Preemptible workers cannot use persistent disk. B. Preemptible workers cannot store data. C. If a preemptible worker is reclaimed, then a replacement worker must be added manually. 
D. A Dataproc cluster cannot have only preemptible workers. 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: The following rules will apply when you use preemptible workers with a Cloud Dataproc cluster: . Processing only—Since preemptibles can be reclaimed at any time, preemptible workers do not store data. Preemptibles added to a Cloud Dataproc cluster only function as processing nodes. . No preemptible-only clusters—To ensure clusters do not lose all workers, Cloud Dataproc cannot create preemptible-only clusters. . Persistent disk size—As a default, all preemptible workers are created with the smaller of 100GB or the primary worker boot disk size. This disk space is used for local caching of data and is not available through HDFS. The managed group automatically re-adds workers lost due to reclamation as capacity permits.

A. before 
B. after 
C. only if 
D. once 
Answer: A 
Explanation: In a Cloud Bigtable architecture all client requests go through a front-end server before they are sent to a Cloud Bigtable node. The nodes are organized into a Cloud Bigtable cluster, which belongs to a Cloud Bigtable instance, which is a container for the cluster. Each node in the cluster handles a subset of the requests to the cluster. When additional nodes are added to a cluster, you can increase the number of simultaneous requests that the cluster can handle, as well as the maximum throughput for the entire cluster.

63. What is the general recommendation when designing your row keys for a Cloud Bigtable schema? 
A. Include multiple time series values within the row key 
B. Keep the row keep as an 8 bit integer C. Keep your row key reasonably short 
D. Keep your row key as long as the field permits 
Answer: C 
Explanation: A general guide is to, keep your row keys reasonably short. Long row keys take up additional memory and storage and increase the time it takes to get responses from the Cloud Bigtable server. 

64. Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding Bigtable access roles? 
A. Using IAM roles, you cannot give a user access to only one table in a project, rather than all tables in a project. B. To give a user access to only one table in a project, grant the user the Bigtable Editor role for that table. 
C. You can configure access control only at the project level. D. To give a user access to only one table in a project, you must configure access through your application.

Explanation: For Cloud Bigtable, you can configure access control at the project level. For example, you can grant the ability to: Read from, but not write to, any table within the project. Read from and write to any table within the project, but not manage instances. Read from and write to any table within the project, and manage instances.

65. For the best possible performance, what is the recommended zone for your Compute Engine instance and Cloud Bigtable instance? 
A. Have the Compute Engine instance in the furthest zone from the Cloud Bigtable instance. B. Have both the Compute Engine instance and the Cloud Bigtable instance to be in different zones. 
C. Have both the Compute Engine instance and the Cloud Bigtable instance to be in the same zone. 
D. Have the Cloud Bigtable instance to be in the same zone as all of the consumers of your data. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: It is recommended to create your Compute Engine instance in the same zone as your Cloud Bigtable instance for the best possible performance, If it's not possible to create a instance in the same zone, you should create your instance in another zone within the same region. For example, if your Cloud Bigtable instance is located in us-central1-b, you could create your instance in us-central1-f. This change may result in several milliseconds of additional latency for each Cloud Bigtable request. It is recommended to avoid creating your Compute Engine instance in a different region from your Cloud Bigtable instance, which can add hundreds of milliseconds of latency to each Cloud Bigtable request.


66. Which row keys are likely to cause a disproportionate number of reads and/or writes on a particular node in a Bigtable cluster (select 2 answers)? 
A. A sequential numeric ID B. A timestamp followed by a stock symbol 
C. A non-sequential numeric ID D. A stock symbol followed by a timestamp 
Answer: AB 
Explanation: ...using a timestamp as the first element of a row key can cause a variety of problems. In brief, when a row key for a time series includes a timestamp, all of your writes will target a single node; fill that node; and then move onto the next node in the cluster, resulting in hotspotting. Suppose your system assigns a numeric ID to each of your application's users. You might be tempted to use the user's numeric ID as the row key for your table. However, since new users are more likely to be active users, this approach is likely to push most of your traffic to a small number of nodes. 

67. When a Cloud Bigtable node fails, ____ is lost. 
A. all data B. no data C. the last transaction 
D. the time dimension 
Answer: B 
Explanation: A Cloud Bigtable table is sharded into blocks of contiguous rows, called tablets, to help balance the workload of queries. Tablets are stored on Colossus, Google's file system, in SSTable format. Each tablet is associated with a specific Cloud Bigtable node. Data is never stored in Cloud Bigtable nodes themselves; each node has pointers to a set of tablets that are stored on Colossus. As a result: Rebalancing tablets from one node to another is very fast, because the actual data is not copied. Cloud Bigtable simply updates the pointers for each node. Recovery from the failure of a Cloud Bigtable node is very fast, because only metadata needs to be migrated to the replacement node. When a Cloud Bigtable node fails, no data is lost

68. Which is not a valid reason for poor Cloud Bigtable performance? 
A. The workload isn't appropriate for Cloud Bigtable. 
B. The table's schema is not designed correctly. C. The Cloud Bigtable cluster has too many nodes. 
D. There are issues with the network connection. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: The Cloud Bigtable cluster doesn't have enough nodes. If your Cloud Bigtable cluster is overloaded, adding more nodes can improve performance. Use the monitoring tools to check whether the cluster is overloaded.

69. Which is the preferred method to use to avoid hotspotting in time series data in Bigtable? 
A. Field promotion 
B. Randomization
C. Salting D. Hashing 
Answer: A 
Explanation: By default, prefer field promotion. Field promotion avoids hotspotting in almost all cases, and it tends to make it easier to design a row key that facilitates queries.

70. When you design a Google Cloud Bigtable schema it is recommended that you _________. 
A. Avoid schema designs that are based on NoSQL concepts B. Create schema designs that are based on a relational database design 
C. Avoid schema designs that require atomicity across rows D. Create schema designs that require atomicity across rows 
Answer: C 
Explanation: All operations are atomic at the row level. For example, if you update two rows in a table, it's possible that one row will be updated successfully and the other update will fail. Avoid schema designs that require atomicity across rows.

71. Which of the following is NOT a valid use case to select HDD (hard disk drives) as the storage for Google Cloud Bigtable? 
A. You expect to store at least 10 TB of data. B. You will mostly run batch workloads with scans and writes, rather than frequently executing random reads of a small number of rows. C. You need to integrate with Google BigQuery. D. You will not use the data to back a user-facing or latency-sensitive application. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: For example, if you plan to store extensive historical data for a large number of remote-sensing devices and then use the data to generate daily reports, the cost savings for HDD storage may justify the performance tradeoff. On the other hand, if you plan to use the data to display a real-time dashboard, it probably would not make sense to use HDD storage—reads would be much more frequent in this case, and reads are much slower with HDD storage. 

72. Cloud Bigtable is Google's ______ Big Data database service.

74. If you're running a performance test that depends upon Cloud Bigtable, all the choices except one below are recommended steps. Which is NOT a recommended step to follow? 
A. Do not use a production instance. B. Run your test for at least 10 minutes. C. Before you test, run a heavy pre-test for several minutes. 
D. Use at least 300 GB of data. 
Answer: A 
Explanation: If you're running a performance test that depends upon Cloud Bigtable, be sure to follow these steps as you plan and execute your test: Use a production instance. A development instance will not give you an accurate sense of how a production instance performs under load. Use at least 300 GB of data. Cloud Bigtable performs best with 1 TB or more of data. However, 300 GB of data is enough to provide reasonable results in a performance test on a 3-node cluster. On larger clusters, use 100 GB of data per node. Before you test, run a heavy pre-test for several minutes. This step gives Cloud Bigtable a chance to balance data across your nodes based on the access patterns it observes. Run your test for at least 10 minutes. This step lets Cloud Bigtable further optimize your data, and it helps ensure that you will test reads from disk as well as cached reads from memory.

However, you noticed that one Hadoop job runs very slowly with Cloud Dataproc, when compared with the on-premises bare-metal Hadoop environment (8-core nodes with 100-GB RAM). Analysis shows that this particular Hadoop job is disk I/O intensive. You want to resolve the issue. What should you do? 
A. Allocate sufficient memory to the Hadoop cluster, so that the intermediary data of that particular Hadoop job can be held in memory B. Allocate sufficient persistent disk space to the Hadoop cluster, and store the intermediate data of that particular Hadoop job on native HDFS 
C. Allocate more CPU cores of the virtual machine instances of the Hadoop cluster so that the networking bandwidth for each instance can scale up D. Allocate additional network interface card (NIC), and configure link aggregation in the operating system to use the combined throughput when working with Cloud Storage

148. You've migrated a Hadoop job from an on-prem cluster to dataproc and GCS. Your Spark job is a complicated analytical workload that consists of many shuffing operations and initial data are parquet files (on average 200-400 MB size each). You see some degradation in performance after the migration to Dataproc, so you'd like to optimize for it. You need to keep in mind that your organization is very cost-sensitive, so you'd like to continue using Dataproc on preemptibles (with 2 non-preemptible workers only) for this workload.  What should you do? (Ensuring solution quality)
Increase the size of your parquet files to ensure them to be 1 GB minimum.
Switch to TFRecords formats (appr. 200MB per file) instead of parquet files.
Switch from HDDs to SSDs, copy initial data from GCS to HDFS, run the Spark job and copy results back to GCS.
Switch from HDDs to SSDs, override the preemptible VMs configuration to increase the boot disk size.
